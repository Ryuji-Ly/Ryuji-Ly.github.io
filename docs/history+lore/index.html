                <h3>The Beginning of Everything</h3>
                <p>At first, there was Nothing. It was the only thing that existed. The concept of Nothing is the most ancient and contradictory concept. After all, how could Nothing be something that is described. Even more so, the very concept of Time, Power, Contradiction did not exist yet, or even just the concept of Concepts.</p>
                <p>Much later, or perhaps just the very next instant, a second concept was born. It was a failed imitationo of Nothing. The Nothing that seemingly stretched endlessly across everything. This second concept was Infinity. Many more concepts were derived from Infinity, among the first were Eternity, Endless, Order, Chaos and Spacetime. This moment in time is also known to be the observable limit for the Transcendents.</p>
                <p>The concepts manifested laws. Laws shaped reality and created a world. The first world to ever exist. By those aware of its existence, it is called the Egg of the Multiverse. On this "egg", the first life was created through the amalgamation of laws. It was a nameless creature without sentience, but the many Supreme Gods would remember this creature as the True Origin Primordial God, while some others would call it the first Heavenly Dao. As the amalgamation of laws and concepts, the creature's life was deeply interconnected with the world's continued existence. Time moved on, the "egg" continued to develop, while more and more concepts were born and refined. At some point, the first life died of old age, and thus, the "egg" hatched.</p>

                <h3>Birth of the Myriad Multiverses</h3>
                <p>The first world exploded into countless fragments, each becoming the core of a multiverse of its own. Each multiverse held a seemingly infinite number of universes, planes, realms and dimensions.</p>
                <p>Each fragment of the first world of course had varying ratios of laws, it was this ratio that determined the main nature of each multiverse. Besides this, each multiverse used the fragmentory laws to recreate their own versions of the original concepts, their universes similary replicated the multiversal version of the concepts. This meant there were various versions of the same concept, all derived from the original from the first world. These origin concepts still existed, however they were forgotten.</p>
                <p>From then on, each multiverse developed differently, beginning their own stories.</p>

                <h3>After the Creation Myth</h3>
                <p>While the multiverses each had their own development path, a lot of them did share some similarities. Namely, the birth of conceptual and primal gods. It was due to their existence that most life forms were created, and therefore born sentient and intelligent. It was relatively peaceful, however strength remained supreme. It was only after the first deaths they grew afraid. They were created without any knowledge about death, it was unfamiliar, and thus they found it unnatural.</p>
                <p>They dared to try and defy death, for they quickly understood what use was strength if a single death was all it took to take it all away? As it was still the Primordial Era, there were many opportunities. Soon, the first mortal who became an Immortal emerged. They had found ways to prolong their lifespan to indefinite, after which began the search to truly defy death. Methods that allowed one to survive being killed. In the more developed multiverses, being an Immortal became the first requirement to being a true powerhouse. Regardless how you much power you had, without immortality, you were considered weak. A mere flicker in the passage of time. Millenia had passed, the majority had long since discovered the existence of parallel universes. Aside from the initial scuffles, it was peaceful, yet also gruesome. Many Immortals managed to assimilate their multiversal variants, becoming stronger and stronger until they were the sole remaining variant of themselves in the multiverse.</p>
                <p>The following trillions of years were exceedingly peaceful, it was a period of accumulation, no method to avoid death was absolute, and more and more techniques were created to counter the methods of other Immortals, so more and more ways to defy death were created. Some of the more older Immortals even had thousands of methods to avoid death. With so many failsafes, the Immortals were more daring and quickly grew their power. However this era of peace came to an end when they discovered the multiversal barriers, evidence of other multiverses.</p>

                <h3>The Grand War of Immortals and Gods</h3>
                <p>This is a war forgotten by most, yet it's aftermath affected the Myriad Multiverses until the end of time itself. Before this war, there were billions of multiverses. It was devastating, almost the entirety of reality as a whole was wiped out, leaving barely a few hundred thousand multiverses. In the entirety of the Myriad Multiverses, there was rarely an occurance the number of multiverses exceeded a million after this war.</p>
                <p>Centillions of Immortals were wiped out with permanent death. Their so-called Immortality was fragile against those who knew the same methods and searched ways to bypass them. Despite how destructive this war was, the more peaceful and rational Immortals have tried to mend the worlds, however most of the destruction was irreparable and destroyed multiverses could not be brought back. Considering many of the Immortals' power and immortality was vested on their multiverses laws, it was discovered destroying a multiverse could greatly weaken an Immortal originating from that multiverse, sometimes outright killing them.</p>
                <p>There was so little left of the Myriad Multiverses when the very last Immortal of the Grand War fell. A handful, just a very lucky 9 Immortals who avoided the wars and somehow survived where all that was left of the Immortals. These 9 were perhaps the only witnesses to one of the most beautiful things of the Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                <p>The countless bodies of fallen Immortals, some as small as a speck of dust, others as large as entire universes, the shattered remains of billions of multiverses, realms, dimensions etc. All these gathered to form one place. A place that would be known as the Realm of Immortals, the hub of the Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                <p>The Realm of Immortals is accessible from anywhere in the Myriad Multiverses, so long certain requirements are met. After the Grand War the spatial barriers between multiverses solidified, no longer allowing intermultiversal travel. Only extremely powerful or very talented spatial Immortals had a chance at travelling to different multiverses. The Realm of Immortals was the only way you could interact and perhaps travel to different multiverses.</p>
