                <h3>The Beginning of Everything</h2>
                <p>At first, there was Nothing. It was the only thing that existed. The concept of Nothing is the most ancient and contradictory concept. After all, how could Nothing be something that is described. Even more so, the very concept of Time, Power, Contradiction did not exist yet, or even just the concept of Concepts.</p>
                <p>Much later, or perhaps just the very next instant, a second concept was born. It was a failed imitationo of Nothing. The Nothing that seemingly stretched endlessly across everything. This second concept was Infinity. Many more concepts were derived from Infinity, among the first were Eternity, Endless, Order, Chaos and Spacetime. This moment in time is also known to be the observable limit for the Transcendents.</p>
                <p>The concepts manifested laws. Laws shaped reality and created a world. The first world to ever exist. By those aware of its existence, it is called the Egg of the Multiverse. On this "egg", the first life was created through the amalgamation of laws. It was a nameless creature without sentience, but the many Supreme Gods would remember this creature as the True Origin Primordial God, while some others would call it the first Heavenly Dao. As the amalgamation of laws and concepts, the creature's life was deeply interconnected with the world's continued existence. Time moved on, the "egg" continued to develop, while more and more concepts were born and refined. At some point, the first life died of old age, and thus, the "egg" hatched.</p>

                <h3>Birth of the Myriad Multiverses</h3>
                <p>The first world exploded into countless fragments, each becoming the core of a multiverse of its own. Each multiverse held a seemingly infinite number of universes, planes, realms and dimensions.</p>
                <p>(To be continued, too lazy right now)</p>
