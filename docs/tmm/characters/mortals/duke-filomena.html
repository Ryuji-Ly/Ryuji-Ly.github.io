                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Duke has the gift of prophecy, however, it is one that has been mutated. Instead of random visions of the future, Duke's gift only activates 24 hours before his death, revealing everything he would experience beforehand. It is essentially a form of regression, without traveling through time.</p>
                <p>He has used this gift to its absolute fullest. Following his non-existent timeline, he has avoided death for many years with his gift. At the age of 24, he uncovered the existence of a new cult, worshipping an ancient, long forgotten god. Their rituals which aimed to bring back one of the 7 ancients weakened the fabric of space. This in turn, lead to their world being discovered and invaded by demonic species. At the age of 42, having repelled all the demons and reinforced the fabric of space, the ancient god returned and enslaved the human race. At the age of 137, humanity successfully rebelled and sealed the ancient god away in the core of the world. The world core, having been weakened by the unstable space, then the invasion of demons, and finally almost entirely drained by the ancient god of all its energy, could no longer sustain itself and shattered.</p>
                <p>Duke committed "suicide" over forty thousand times. It was an exploit he had found over the years, a way to see more than a day into the future. In this way, when the true timeline's Duke activated his gift for the first time, he was flooded with over 120 years worth of memories. He witnessed all these future versions of himself kill themselves, even though their existence only exist in the visions of the past Duke, their actions are those Duke would have taken himself had he been in their position.</p>
                <p>Armed with all this information and experience, Duke prevented the cult from ever gaining a massive following, preventing all the after effects caused by it. He rapidly rose into power and formed an alliance with all the major powers. Soon however, he grew bored, aside from the occasional vision of succeeded assassinations, which he then easily prevented, he was swamped with paperwork.</p>
                <p>He launched an invasion upon the demons, he waged war for nearly a century but failed to conquer the demon worlds, unsatisfied, he decided to turn the past century into a prophecy as well, making the war of conquest in the true timeline far more efficient and fast, even so, he failed to eradicate the last of the demons entirely. It was the work of an insane man who at a moments notice could decide to turn several years into a mere prophecy to be passed onto his passed self while invalidating his current self. The third time, no demon escaped his reach.</p>
                <p>At the end of his life at the age of 376, he realized he had reached the limit his lifespan allowed him. Perhaps, if he killed himself over and over, try again, then repeat, maybe he would find a way to prolong his life or even make it eternal.</p>
                <p>"Enough is enough. I have lived a very exciting life already. There is no more that I wish to experience in this wide world"</p>
