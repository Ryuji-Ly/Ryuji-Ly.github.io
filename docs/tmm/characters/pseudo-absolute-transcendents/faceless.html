                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>An entity who stole the ability to reincarnate from a phoenix. Even after obtaining Transcendence, it is the backbone of their identity and source of their rise.</p>
                <p>Faceless has two innate abilities, namely Dream Walking and Corrupting. Another ability Faceless has learned and mastered is cloning. Many of their clones do not even know they are clones. They can also infect others with soul fragments of themselves to slowly convert them into one of the Faceless. This technique also allows any offspring of the clones to act as another extension of Faceless.</p>
                <p>The clones can exist independently from the main body. The main body has been killed numerous times, very rarely dying of old age, it is the ability to reincarnate that allowed Faceless to remain above everyone else. There are also times Faceless purposefully reincarnated, using the passage of time between reincarnations to speed up the process of corrupting entire worlds with their clones from his perspective.</p>
                <p>Faceless accumulated a myriad of alternate bodies as time passed. There are 4 multiverses composed entirely out of the Faceless, and several more with more than half corrupted. For the remainder of time, there were far too many outstanding people who noticed Faceless and blocked their attempts to spread.</p>
