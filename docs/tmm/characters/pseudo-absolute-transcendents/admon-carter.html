                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Born with the ability to absorb everything and incorporate it within his body, as well as alter his physical structure. Admon Carter absorbed his own mother as well as everything around him when he was a young child and his ability went beyond his control.</p>
                <p>Ever since, he has been pessimistic and despises optimistic people, despite this, he joins <a href="../absolute-transcendents/alden.html">Alden Wall Miller</a> on his quest to end the Bloodless War. However after the death of a father figure for the party, Admon believes life to have no value and let go of his trauma. He discarded his preconceptions regarding good and evil, only enforcing his own, personal justice upon the world.</p>
                <p>He awakened one of his latent abilities to Overwrite the natural order, which he later used to project his own definition of his True Self to become a Transcendent.</p>
                <p>Admon later goes to dethrone the First Spirit King Uliu, which throws the Spirit Plane into chaos.</p>
