                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The Tyrant is what you would call pure, brute strength. Grown up as an orphan as well as cast aside by society, he was enraged. This rage fueled his rapid growth all the way to Transcendence, even helping him obtain Transcendence through pure arrogance and rage.</p>
                <p>There are few who are as arrogant as the Tyrant, however, unlike most, the line between arrogance and pride is extremely thin for the Tyrant, as his arrogance is justified with his strength.</p>
                <p>Even with various boosting skills and temporary buffs, everyone has a limit they cannot surpass. The Tyrant can break through that limit, pushing his combat strength to the absolute peak, rivalling the physical ability of the average Absolute Transcendent. However as he cannot control his power, nor surpass his limits when he wants, he merely ranked 8th among the Pseudo-Absolute Transcendents. </p>
