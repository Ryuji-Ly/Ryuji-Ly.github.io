                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Born on the planet known as Adachit which was later used as the base for the megaplanet Yumiline, the capital planet of The Divine Empire. Her original race is Nosferatu, one of the more ancient variants of the modern vampire.</p>
                <p>Many overlook her, simply knowing her as the wife of Deus. However only her status of Transcendent could barely hope to match the quality of her title as The Empress. All other nicknames and titles pale in comparison and were deemed unfit to be displayed with The Empress.</p>
                <p>She holds two dominions. Force and Source. These two dominions define The Empress. The forces of creation at her command. All those sentient are hers to rule.</p>
                <p>Before the creation of the Almighty Army and the Three Grand Generals, it was Eirlys who led Deus' meagre forces to battle, abandoning her favoured weapon and combat style using daggers, she picked up the spear. Despite having no talent with the weapon, she claimed victory after victory.</p>
                <p>There was a point in time Deus' enemies feared Eirlys more than Deus himself.</p>
                <p>After Deus achieved Pseudo-Transcendence and created the Divine Empire and created 17 megaplanets for it, Eirlys no longer needed to enter a battlefield ever again. After the birth of her two children she mellowed out a lot, becoming known as the epitome of gentleness.</p>
                <p>When Deus vanished and the three Grand Generals wrecked havoc upon all 17 megaplanets, the first thing they did was seal Eirlys and cast her into a spacetime vortex.</p>
                <p>Despite her power, the Grand Generals were created to protect her and were far more powerful, her combat skills had deteriorated as well.</p>
                <p>Once more, she stepped onto a path of blood. She was flung into a different multiverse alltogether, with the concepts that were the foundations of her abilities, Eirlys only had her body to rely on. She defeated powerful beasts, making them yield, while simultaneously earning the awe and respect of the sapients of the world. One duel after the other. Unwittingly she gained a massive following.</p>
                <p>They were more of a hinderence, a liability. However it was here that she decided what kind of person she would be. She declared to the world there would be a new nation. To all those that objected her claim, she dueled every single kingdom.</p>
                <p>One against a nation. Without killing a single unworthy soul, she singlehandedly forced an entire nation to recognise her own as legitimate. Each duel took less than a week.</p>
                <p>By the time she could pierce the multiversal barriers, the Blood Age was ended by her son.</p>
                <p>Among Transcendents, Eirlys stands unique, having a mastery over Sources comparable to the Heavenly Demon. The Master Librarian once asked how she did not have an Authority, not even a Pseudo Authority. Eirlys simply responded, I will not distance myself anymore than I already have from my subjects.</p>
                <p>Eirlys is an Entity who commands respect from all who are fortunate to encounter her.</p>
