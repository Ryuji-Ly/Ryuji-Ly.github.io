                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Born as the prince of the Deus Empire, he had everything. He lead another life as the Protector God of the Divine Empire known as Ancile, famous as a master of chain weapons, who smelted them down to form a shield to symbolize his Will to defend the Empire.</p>
                <p>He was never really famous under his identity as Alden, but as Ancile, he was loved by many. However, good times did not last long, as Deus, his father, vanished. Alden maintained order while in search of Deus, mobilising the Silver Guardians for this purpose, the most elite task force under the Empire, founded by Alden himself.</p>
                <p>The search ended fruitlessly, and they fell into a deep slumber one by one due to severe injuries of the lesser void. The three Grand Generals of the Deus Army took advantage of their absence and waged war for the throne, marking the start of the Blood Era and the Bloodless War.</p>
                <p>Many years later, it is a battle between the Generals that caused Alden to wake up prematurely, rising from next to the world core to a nearby dungeon. As he had yet to finish recovering, many of his abilities were sealed, while Alden himself found himself without any memories other than his name and his combat instinct.</p>
                <p>Regardless, Alden remained unfazed by the situation, instead opting to travel the worlds. The more he did so however, the more he found out about the Bloodless War. He felt a growing need to put an end to it, gathering various people for the same purpose.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, his mere presence awoke the remaining Silver Guardians whose main duty is to protect Alden. It was not long after that he regained his Transcendent status and regained his memories, finally putting end to the War. He ushered the Silver Era of the Deus Empire and was a decent ruler. After many eons, he grew tired and passed the throne to one of his sons. He decided to fully connect with the Time Stream, no longer interfering with the world, merely ensuring the continued existence of his Authority.</p>
