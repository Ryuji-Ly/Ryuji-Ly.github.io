                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Jejaha, better known as the Master Librarian, is in simple terms, a reader. His given duty is to sort and read every record of the <a href="../../worlds/akashic-records.html">Akashic Records</a>. He loves to immerse himself into the countless records that exist in the Infinite Library. As a non-combatant, he is similarly to the <a href="./angela.html">Life Sovereign</a> known as the weakest of the Absolute Transcendents. For those under the Absolute Transcendents however, he can be considered among the most dangerous.</p>
                <p>The Master Librarian holds the Authority over Existence, he serves as a witness to All of Creation. The principle behind his duty is simple. That which is not observed, does not exist. The Master Librarian can choose to disregard, to ignore your very existence, eliminate the absolute proof that you exist, and so it shall be.</p>
                <p>Not even Transcendents, who gain immunity to the conceptual having broken free of those limitations, nor Absolutes who can govern over the foundational building blocks of the Myriad Multiverses can undo the effects of the Master Librarian's disregard. It is only with the combined status of Transcendence and Absolute that you gain immunity to his abilities.</p>
