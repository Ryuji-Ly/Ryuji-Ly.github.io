                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Cristina was created as a gift for Deus' wife, serving as a battle maid. After the physical death of <a href="../transcendents/eirlys-nicht.html">her Mistress</a>, she was left forgotten and heavily wounded in the midst of billions of corpses belonging to the allied army which attacked <a href="../transcendents/eirlys-nicht.html">her Mistress'</a> settlement while Deus was asleep.</p>
                <p>Unable to die or move, she remained there for months as she slowly regenerated. Resentment towards her creator did not exist. She had been created for the sole purpose of serving and protecting the Empress, she was no longer necessary when there was no Empress to speak of.</p>
                <p>She yearned for social contact, however her nature as an Immortal made it nigh impossible, thus, began her eternal wander. Once mastering all forms of combat, confident in her strength, she left the confines of her origin universe and entered <a href="../../worlds/realm-of-immortals.html">the Realm of Immortals</a>.</p>
                <p>Her first encounter was with an unruly Immortal God, whom she managed to kill. This naturally infuriated the Immortal God who tried to kill Cristina in response. It took her 83 times before she figured out a way to grant the Immortal God a permanent death. The Divine Society behind the dead Immortal God put up a bounty on her. It took her a long time, however she had managed to eradicate every single Immortal of the Divine Society permanently.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, this feat caught the attention of a Supreme God, <a href="../immortals/primal-monarch.html">Primal Monarch</a>. Cristina had to seclude herself in a remote planet in a multiverse not yet connected to the <a href="../../worlds/realm-of-immortals.html">Realm of Immortals</a> where she deviated from the path of Immortals and became a Transcendent after many billions of years, subsequently, an Absolute, becoming the last of the 13 Absolute Transcendents to obtain that status in the linear timeline.</p>
