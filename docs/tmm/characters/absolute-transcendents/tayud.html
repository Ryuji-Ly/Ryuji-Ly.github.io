                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Tayud is mostly known only as the first living entity created by Deus. He was created by pre-Transcendence Deus during his thousand years of seclusion when he was dabbling in the creation of artificial life. Due to this emotional significance, Deus repeatedly modified him as he improved, Tayud later became a lab assistant of Deus rather than a test subject. Once Deus' seclusion ended, Tayud was left to do whatever he wanted.</p>
                <p>He roamed many dimensions, universes and multiverses in an attempt to find his purpose and identity. Over the course of his journey, he accumulated thousands of legends speaking of his feats. After becoming a Transcendent he settled down in a faraway corner of the Myriad Multiverses where he became an Absolute. He married a mortal woman.</p>
                <p>It is something a Transcendent would rarely do if not never. The existence of a mortal is simply too frail, a single walk through time and they could have never existed in the first place, not to mention, from the perspective of an Ascendant, a mortal is esssentially a bag of impurity, both in soul and body. All this is even more so for an Absolute Transcendent, as the Absolute of Dream, Tayud could quite literally manifest his ideal partner into existence, or absorb everyone into his dream and dissolve it.</p>
                <p>He has many ways to make her an Immortal, or a Transcendent, instead, he merely made her unique in the Myriad Multiverses, similar to a Transcendent, except without her True Self. He chases her from reincarnation to reincarnation.</p>
