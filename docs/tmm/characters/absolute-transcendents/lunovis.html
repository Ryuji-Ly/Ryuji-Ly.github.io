                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The sole Absolute who has ever obtained the status of Absolute twice. Lunovis is an extremely fickle character despite his duty as Great Guardian. Unlike the other four Great Guardians, the Heavenly Demon does not actively work to fulfill his duty. Quite the contrary, as he plays around as he pleases. He moves based solely on his own amusement or annoyance. He is both the savior and the doomsday.</p>
                <p>It is a consequence of his actions that always pushes karma to balance itself. As such, while he does not intend for it, he is the most active among the Great Guardians when it comes to fulfilling his duty.</p>
                <p>Another activity that sets the Heavenly Demon apart from other Absolute Transcendents is his meddling with the <a href="../../worlds/source-world.html">Source World</a>. Not simple messing around either, he takes the Sources of others and integrates it with his own, effectively merging them. For the sake of understanding, you can think of these individuals whose Sources have been merged as a clone of Lunovis (This is entirely incorrect). These "clones" are called Faces of Lunovis. He has at least one Face of Lunovis in about 70% of all universes. Mind you, not multiverses, but universes.</p>
                <p>See: Worlds > <a href="../../worlds/source-world.html">Source World</a> for more details. All life has a Source in the <a href="../../worlds/source-world.html">Source World</a> which contains all data regarding the entity, past, present, future, alternate universes etc. It also defines what is a "real" instance of an entity. A perfect genetic clone with the same memories is considered its own separate entity. Sources are incredibly delicate, a single improper adjustment can erase all traces of an entity, similar to the <a href="../../general/concepts/erosion-of-nothingness.html">erosion of nothingness</a>. While the Source of an Absolute Transcendent is far more resilient and capable of recovering lost data, not even they meddle with their own Source in fear of changing the core of their existence. The Heavenly Demon on the other hand, does it as often as he breathes (not really, he doesn't even breathe, but you get the idea), even further, he goes and merges the Sources of others into his own.</p>
                <p>The Faces of Lunovis and Lunovis are considered the same entity, and yet, each are entirely independent and have their own life, similar to an entity before Transcendence and all their parallel universe instances.</p>
