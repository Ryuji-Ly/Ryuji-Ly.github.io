        <h1>Great Guardians</h1>
        <div id="general-info">
            <p>The Great Guardians are the Absolute Transcendents created with the purpose of maintaining the Myriad Multiverses. They inherently do not have any desires that do not align with said purpose.</p>
            <p>The Guardian of Void Mendezlok is tasked with keeping the erosion of nothingness at bay. While initially his Authority of Void is among the most benevolent and gentle of concepts, it has been contaminated by Nothing for far too long, making the Void that lay beneath the fabric of space extremely hostile to all.</p>
            <p>The Guardian of Space Gahart works together with Mendezlok in acting as a barrier between Nothing and the Myriad Multiverses. He is responsible for all things related to space, dimensions, realms and so on.</p>
