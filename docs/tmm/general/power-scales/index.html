        <h1>Power Scales</h1>
        <div id="general-info">
            <p>The measurement of power is somewhat generalized, althought there are always outliers here and there. Starting with the first category, the Mortals.</p>
            <p>Mortals, the epitome of weakness, as well as the starting point for all.</p>
            <p>For Mortals, the first is known as Base Mortal. Already there is a pretty wide gap between Base Mortals. It is the absolute base of an entity, defined by their species and genealogy. There are species that can only be considered harmless, while others are living calamities. There are even some species with no upper limit of growth, hence, the categorization and criteria do not apply well on such species.</p>
            <p>After Base Mortal are the Awakened. Those who learn from the supernatural, or push beyond their physical limits. It is when entities break through their individual limitations.</p>
            <p>The Enlightened are those that have begun to or have mastered their path. Already, are they capable of planetary destruction.</p>
            <p>The Exalted are those who have reached the pinnacle of mortality. Having shed nearly all limitations placed upon them by their species, biology aand talent. With far longer lifespan, they are often revered as demigods.</p>
            <p>The final stage of mortality. The Ascended Mortal. It is the threshold. At this stage, while still technically mortal, they operate on a higher plane of existence. Capable of manipulating the laws that govern their world. Their lifespan can outlast their own universe, very rarely can Ascended be killed so long they do not provoke the higher entities.</p>
            <p>Immortals, those that fear death, shall do anything within their power to avoid it.</p>
            <p>Gods. Fools who only rely on the faith of others to build up their strength. While the upper limit is high, it is simply far too easy to kill a God for them to be taken seriously by the Immortals.</p>
            <p>The Low Rank Immortals are diverse. There is no lower limit in strength requirement. The only requirement to be classified as a low rank Immortal is to have an eternal lifespan, as well as a reusable method to return to life if killed that does not affect said eternal lifespan. Many that are categorized in this stage will eventually reach for higher stages, even if it takes an inconceivable amount of time.</p>
            <p>The Mid Rank Immortals are compared to the Ascended Mortals, except they have gained permanence in their existence.</p>
            <p>The High Rank Immortals can exert their will unto reality, permanently bending a section of their universe to their will.</p>
            <p>The Pinnacle Immortals have reached the absolute limit of individual power. Their very thought can influence the world around them. The Pinnacle Immortals have touched upon the realm of Concepts.</p>
            <p>Immortal Gods, graded similarly to the Immortals, except with a far higher upper limit.</p>
            <p>The Low Rank Immortal Gods, they have control over laws but may lack finesse and broader influence. They use faith as a basis to explore and command the laws of their universe.</p>
            <p>The Mid Rank Immortal Gods, their influence over laws have reached the universal stage, capable of directing an entire universe according to their will.</p>
            <p>The High Rank Immortal Gods, the complete mastery over multiversal laws, they have touched upon the realm of Concepts, even going up to the Universal concepts.</p>
            <p>The Pinnacle Immortal Gods. The overlord of their respective multiverse. Their vast power can reshape or destroy multiverses without affecting themselves detrimentally.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Gods, a stage that was defined by the Pinnacle Immortal Gods themselves, encoding it into the very fabric of the Realm of Immortals, granting them far more power. The Supreme Gods are the strongest of the Pinnacle Immortal Gods of a multiverse.</p>
            <p>Once again, it should be noted that all of the above have different names, subdivisions of their own and so on in various multiverses. The current names are the most well known and widely used.</p>
            <p>Transcendents, those who seek power must grasp it from within.</p>
            <p>There are no real subdivisions of Transcendents. There are those who are Transcendents, and those who are not. Transcendents are mostly immune to the influence and affects of all laws and have great immunity towards lower Concepts. By virtue of their existence, they have conquered their origin multiverse. More often than not, they are compared to High or Pinnacle Immortal Gods, but the upper limit is far beyond that of Supreme Gods.</p>
            <p>Absolutes, those who grasp Authority, are those who must be feared.</p>
            <p>Most Absolutes are still considered Mortals, as they will die quite easily from both external and internal sources. However when they are alive, they are the nightmares of Immortals. Absolutes are those who understand an Origin Concept so deeply they manage to grasp its Authority. In essence, they can command a fundamental concept that makes up the entire Myriad Multiverses. For Immortals that use laws, the derivatives and manifestations of concepts, Absolutes are entirely immune to their powers.</p>
            <p>Only Transcendents, who are resistant to conceptual attacks can hope to kill an Absolute, even then, in most cases, the Absolute will prevail.</p>
