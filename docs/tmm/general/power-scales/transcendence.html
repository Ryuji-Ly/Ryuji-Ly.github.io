        <h1>Transcendence</h1>
        <div id="general-info">
            <p>Transcendents, beings mentioned rather often if it is not about Immortals. Transcendence is one of two pinnacles of power in the Myriad Multiverses. But what exactly is it? What puts them so much above everyone else?</p>
            <p>There are many ways to obtain Transcendence, but the core of them all is to find or create your True Self. In simple terms, an anchor. More on that later, first let us go over some of the more popular methods to Transcendence.</p>
            <p>The "easiest" and most guaranteed to work is to devour and assimilate with parallel versions, variants, of yourself. The final victor of this, his original self will be the main personality for sure, but all other selfs that were defeated would also be influencing them constantly.</p>
            <p>The other more common method is one of self-discovery and reflection. Grasping what makes you, you, defining it and integrating it.</p>
            <p>The last method discussed here is one that is similarly brute force like the first method, but far more difficult. Creating your own True Self and enforcing it upon the world. In essence, forcing the world to recognise your created True Self as legitimate.</p>
            <p>Now what is the True Self? As mentioned it is an anchor, the core of your existence that cannot be affected by any external influence. As for what permits this immunity? The True Self is a bridge that directly connects you with the Source. Many are not aware of this, very few discover the Source World, and those that do only find it through the connection given by the True Self.</p>
            <p>Now that we know that Transcendence is just the term for True Self, and Transcendents are those who obtained their True Self, what are the basic abilities and traits that all Transcendents have?</p>
            <p>Due to the nature of the True Self, by default, Transcendents are immune to the influence of laws, and highly resistant to even conceptual influences.</p>
            <p>Becoming a Transcendent is by extension, elevating yourself in the spectrum of existence, so much so not even time can bind you. It allows you to connect your mind with the Time Stream. Moreover, those proficient in time cannot meddle with your past to sabotage you as you replace all past and parallel instances of yourself before Transcendence with a Will clone. These Will clones can also be scattered across time and space, learning on your behalf. Studying under the scholars of the past or training with future masters, it all becomes possible. You can recall Will clones and absorb all their experiences.</p>
            <p>By definition, Transcending means surpassing the current plane. This applies even to the Myriad Multiverses. They are no longer dependent on the continued existence of the Myriad Multiverses to sustain themselves. In other words, they can exist outside of the Myriad Multiverses, of course, as everything outside of the Myriad Multiverses is merely Nothing, they will get eroded and return to nothingness, from the perspective of the Myriad Multiverse, they can last a few hours in Nothingness.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the very method at which they travel around the Myriad Multiverses is fundamentally different. The more normal methods are super speed, teleportation, portals, warp travel and so on. For the sake of understanding, here's an analogy, there is a boardgame, the pieces of that boardgame can move by themselves but are limited by the rules, blockades and their own ability to move around. In the case of a player they can pick up a piece and move them anywhere they want inside the boardgame. Transcendence allows the entity to move around the Myriad Multiverses as if moved by such a player. They wish to go to a specific place and time? Then reality shall be as such.</p>
            <p>Funnily enough, the Transcendents are far more "Immortal" than even the Immortals. The core reason why Immortals are Immortals are abilities, methods that avoid death, or undo death. In the case of Transcendents, they are, just as an addition to their traits, functionally Immortal. Obtaining Transcendence transforms your body, soul and mind. Aside from Transcendent or Conceptual attacks, nothing can harm a Transcendent's body. In addition, as long as the True Self exists, they cannot ever die from natural causes. Even if one were to kill a Transcendent, so long as one part remains, the others can recover. The body can reform both soul and mind. The soul can reform both body and mind. The mind can possess weaker minds and turn their bodies and souls into their own. There are exceptions, some who lack a part, or those who have merged them into one, but they have similar paths of recovery.</p>
            <p>Once again, all of these are only the most basic of abilities and traits a Transcendent has by mere virtue of obtaining Transcendence. Each Transcendent from then on learns, obtains, enhances or evolves based on their True Self as well as method of obtaining the True Self.</p>
            <p>There are a myriad of paths to power, every second, more are created. But only two paths lead to the pinnacle of the Myriad Multiverses.</p>
