        <h1>Origin Concepts</h1>
        <div id="general-info">
            <p>Origin Concepts are known as the first Concept of their kind. The first Concept is known as Nothing, while the second is known as Infinity. It is from Infinity that all else is born. It is during the process in which The Myriad Multiverses is formed that duplicate, lesser copies of the orignal were created. As the origin of these lesser copies, Origin Concepts have complete control over every aspect of it. They can also exert a significant influence to sub-concepts that are derived from the Origin Concept but are also an Origin Concept.</p>
            <p>The Origin Concepts are rarely touched upon, only Absolutes and certain Supreme Gods are even aware of its existence. In actuality, most do not even know of a hierarchy between concepts, merely, they see the way concepts manifest in reality as laws. Even then, the overwhelming majority of mortals can never hope to see, understand or influence laws.</p>
            <p>Concepts are capable of gaining sentience, in fact, in almost every layer of the hierarchy, the concepts of sentience, consciousness, intellect and so on do gain some form of sentience, but it is not common, most concepts simply exist. It is the laws that are manifested from the concepts that are active but even then, the laws move solely based on the nature of the concepts without any real intellect.</p>
            <p>For Origin Concepts, it is even more difficult to gain sentience. Some that have achieved this are the Origin Concepts of Infinity, Eternity, Sentience and Frequency. The Origin Concept of Infinity is more commonly known as the entity named Deus.</p>
