        <h1>Erosion of Nothingness</h1>
        <div id="general-info">
            <p>The Origin Concept of Nothing is something that cannot and does not exist. It is through the mere act of acknowledging its existence that is exerts influence. However if you do not acknowledge its existence, then it becomes even more "real". The "Sea of Nothing" is brought forth by the imagination of many and exists everywhere that is not The Myriad Multiverses.</p>
            <p>Those that are foolish enough to venture outside the protection of The Myriad Multiverses will return to the true origin, Nothing. It is only a Transcendent that can survive for more than a moment in the "Sea of Nothing", but even they will fall after a short while.</p>
            <p>Those who have "returned to the true origin", are deleted from reality. Every single trace of their existence is wiped away, hence, strictly speaking, not a single person has returned to the true origin.</p>
            <p>The Erosion of Nothing is the constant effect that is exerted unto The Myriad Multiverses, it is a force that aims to clear out all things and return to the unending Nothing.</p>
