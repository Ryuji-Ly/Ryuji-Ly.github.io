        <h1>Source</h1>
        <div id="general-info">
            <p>The Source, likened to a higher level of soul. In many worlds, an entity is composed of a physical body, an astral soul, as well as the formless mind/will. Some types of entities can lack a physical body, some even lack the "soul", others lack the mind, some exist solely as a soul, or solely as a formless mind. Some more rarer entities do not have any of them and exist on an entirely different way.</p>
            <p>In such a situation, what role does the Source play? Simply put, nothing, yet everything. It is an immutable Record of everything of an Entity. The Source can exist independently from an Entity, but the Entity cannot exist without the Source, in most cases at least.</p>
            <p>Using an analogy, take a computer application. Breaking it down, it usually has an executable. We could liken it to the mind. Then there are the other files and folders, though very rough and not entirely right, these can be likened to the body. The actual content of the files and folders can be likened to the soul. In this relationship, where does the Source fit in? Well, in the analogy, the Source would be the server from which you downloaded the application from.</p>
            <p>It was a very crude analogy, since the Source actually also has all the data of every change that happens to the local files, across every single "downloaded" instance of the application.</p>
            <p>Once again, the Source is the complete Record of an entity of it's entire life, from birth to end, on every single possible variant, parallel worlds.</p>
            <p>More than just Records, it is intricately tied to the Entity, it is named Source for a reason. All entities are linked to the Source, should the Source be destroyed, so will the entity.</p>
            <p>A being of very high status or perception can see the Source World and use it to perfectly resurrect a dead entity.</p>
