                <p>Body: Upon birth, Death Hunters are blobs of pure energy, peaceful and formless. Once activated, they take the form of the first life form they encounter and kill, constantly evolving their form to enhance their efficiency in slaughter.</p>
                <p>Final Form: In their final stage, they combine features from various life forms they have encountered, creating a more efficient killing machine. They can morph and shift parts of their body to adapt to new threats.</p>

            <article id="nature">
                <h2>Nature</h2>
                <p>Origin: Death Hunters are direct creations of Deus, recreated species from the Forgotten Grand War, designed by the Immortals to attack other multiverses.</p>
                <p>Behavior: Initially peaceful, Death Hunters become activated upon perceiving any form of life, driven by a single purpose: to slaughter. They derive extreme pleasure from ending life and are guided by a Hivemind focused on the singular thought of "Kill".</p>
                <p>Lifecycle: From peaceful energy blobs to relentless hunters, Death Hunters evolve through encounters with life forms, culminating in a final stage where they become nearly unstoppable predators.</p>
                <p>Sentience: While achieving sentience is rare, overcoming their instinct to kill is borderline impossible. However, Entity Damian is a unique case, having broken free from the Hivemind, gained sentience, and learned to love and create life.</p>

            <article id="culture">
                <h2>Culture</h2>
                <p>Hivemind: Death Hunters share a collective consciousness focused on killing. Their culture, if it can be called such, is centered around their singular goal of eradicating life. They are lone predators, rarely encountering others of their kind.</p>

            <article id="habitat">
                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p>Void Born: Death Hunters are born from the depths of the void, making them extremely rare. They do not have a specific habitat and can adapt to any environment, constantly traveling from one universe to another in their quest to eradicate life.</p>
                <p>Solitary Existence: Due to their rarity and nature, they lead solitary existences, each driven by their instinct to kill and the directives of the Hivemind.</p>
