                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>This section is entirely dedicated to the Myriad Multiverses, a world I have designed over the course of nearly a decade now, having begun since 2016. While I have written many stories and various ideas, I never really published it, but I do not want this world to die and collect dust in my laptop, so even if it is unseen by most, I want traces of its existence left behind here.</p>
                <p>It is recommended you start with the Creation Myth of The Myriad Multiverses which is found in the History & Lore section.</p>
