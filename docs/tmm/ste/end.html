                <div id="locked">
                    <p>I did not expect this. Perhaps, no one did. After all, as long as Deus exists, so did the Myriad Multiverses. At least, that is what I assumed. That is what everyone assumed. The Myriad Multiverses was equivalent to a part of Deus' own body. How could it not?</p>
                    <p>Creation is ending. Everything is returning to nothingness. It had happened so abruptly. An event that is not recorded in the Akashic Records. What could be recorded when the Time Stream was broken?</p>
                    <p>If I were to describe it, it is as if Nothing gained sentience and rapidly increased the erosion of nothingness. We Absolute Transcendents all did our part.</p>
                    <p>Alden was the first who made the decision. He sacrificed his own Source to cover a large portion of the Myriad Multiverses, serving as a wall to protect against the erosion. His fellow Silver Guardians followed suit. Aled, Balaram, God Reaper and Angela. They all broke their own Source and scattered it to shield the Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                    <p>The Akashic Records was forced into a stable dimension, time in the Akashic Records was condensed back into linear flow. Many parts of the library were broken or lost. The higher dimensions were collapsing.</p>
                    <p>The spiritual and elemental Realms were the first sentient ones to discover the erosion. They were also the first of many to return to nothingness.</p>
                    <p>The billions of underworlds, afterlives went next. The Cycle of Reincarnation was broken.</p>
                    <p>My dear friend, Gahart too, returned to nothingness. The space he maintained would become far too chaotic without someone managing it in these times. Mendezlok claimed ownership over the Authority of Space and took over his job.</p>
                    <p>Quintillions of eons, so many epochs, so many Immortals, so many Gods. There are already a seemingly unending number of Immortals who came and went.</p>
                    <p>What of the mortals? They have such a short lifespan. during the life of one Immortal, a single family alone could have millions of generations. So many people. There are so many multiverses, within which are the various dimensions, realms and universes. Each universe has a seemingly endless number of stars. So many lifes. So many people.</p>
                    <p>I, Jejaha, have witnessed every single individual. I have seen things that cannot be fathomed. I know secrets that must never be revealed.</p>
                    <p>But all feels so meaningless in front of the full power of Nothing. The end of all creation. It will all end, just like a fleeting dream. All these so many's will be forgotten.</p>
                    <p>The dimensional barriers are unstable, collapsing. Mendezlok is taking the largest part of the erosion, despite that, he is also taking on the duties of another Great Guardian. The Sources of the Silver Guardians help, but not much.</p>
                    <p>I cannot do anything. I can only bear witness to this moment.</p>
                    <p>For that is what I am. A librarian, a reader, the one who sees everything and affirms their existence.</p>
                    <p>Causality is breaking. The myriad Faces of Lunovis are dying.</p>
                    <p>Angemartin is losing pieces of his Authority. The time axes are falling apart. The world lines can no longer be differentiated. They are colliding, the already fragile space is being shattered every passing moment.</p>
                    <p>To think, even a Great Guardian can feel such deep fear. Is this what Deus faces?</p>
                    <p>It is only through luck that I survived this long, courtesy to Anastasia and Cristina. Lunovis is also taking part of my burden. Otherwise, as the weakest of the Absolute Transcendents, I would have returned to nothingness a long time ago.</p>
                    <p>Mendezlok could not restrain all of the erosion. It was just a small smidgen, yet that was all it took to wipe out hundreds of multiverses. Without the power of Transcendence and Authority to bolster it, everything is far too fragile in front of Nothing.</p>
                    <p>How long has it been? Mere seconds? A few millenia? The flow of time in the Myriad Multiverses is being affected by all the different multiverses and even universes. It is no longer constant.</p>
                    <p>Cristina, the so called Abandonded Subject, the loyal servant of the Empress, forgotten, but rose to Absolute Transcendence. She does not need to do this. But she too, actively helped resist the inevitable.</p>
                    <p>Just a bit longer...</p>
                    <p>I already knew from the moment this all began, creation would come to an end. However... Just a little bit longer.</p>
                    <p>The mortal lives are just as precious as any other. Their lives should not end so abrubtly. The newer generation will be born in a dying world. Their very mentality would be vastly different. So. Just a little longer. A few thousand years at least.</p>
                    <p>The Immortals noticed the erosion as well. It is hard not to.</p>
                    <p>Angemartin was the next to go. Lunovis took on the Authority of Time.</p>
                    <p>I wonder. Will Deus return?</p>
                    <p>Even Alden, his son awakened from his slumber to resist Nothing. Eirlys, his wife returned as well. Not even I could find out where she was, but at the end of everything, she was here. Standing proudly as her existence faded.</p>
                    <p>Where is he, I wonder.</p>
                    <p>More than half of the Myriad Multiverses is gone. A large portion of my Source has been eroded. I do not have much time left. Lunovis will take care of my Authority.</p>
                    <p>Anastasia set fire to her existence, burning herself to fuel Mendelok.</p>
                    <p>Tayud, although less suited than Cristina and Anastasia, supported my existence with his own.</p>
                    <p>I do not deserve this. However, I must continue to record everything I see. I must leave behind proof of our existence.</p>
                    <p>I can feel it, Tayud is crumbling down, and almost simultaniously, as am I.</p>
                    <p>Just a little more...</p>
                    <p>In the end, Mendezlok and Lunovis are the last line of defense. Heh, the two strongest of the Absolute Transcendents.</p>
                    <p>...</p>
                    <p>In all my travels, I have seen and done many things. Perhaps Jejaha already knew this was coming, deep down somewhere. He knew everything after all.</p>
                    <p>It is wrong to say that I have governed and managed causality and karma. I cannot look into the past Records on how Jejaha viewed me, they are far too fragmented. He may have misinterpreted what he saw. I may hold the Authorities, but I never truly use them as intended or as per my assigned duty. I simply do my own thing, and trust in Deus' design that everything will work out in the end.</p>
                    <p>I did not restrict myself to the identity of a Guardian. Now that I am recording this, in hindsight, you could even say I was escaping that identity through my Faces.</p>
                    <p>I suppose now, all of it does not matter. There is only one realm left untouched by the erosion. The Realm of Immortals. The Supreme Council attempted to save a few mutiverses by pulling them into the Realm of Immortals. Far more Immortals died now than the past million eons.</p>
                    <p>I thought I had seen everything, especially now with the Authority of Existence pulsing within me, feeding me fragments of all the Records of the past. Hence, I thought I would never be surprised. I stand corrected, not once did I even consider the possibility that we Absolute Transcendents would face true death, fear and despair.</p>
                    <p>I cannot say with confidence that I do not feel fear right now. A large portion of my Source has been eroded, all of my Faces. The corse part of my Source is also being eroded.</p>
                    <p>Mendezlok passed.</p>
                    <p>I have inherited 5 Authorities.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Void, Mendezlok.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Space, Gahart.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Time, Angemartin.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Existence, Jejaha.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Dream, Tayud.</p>
                    <p>I was named the strongest Absolute Transcendent as I held two Authorities. Achieving Absolute in two fields. Now, at the end of creation, I hold 7.</p>
                    <p>So be it. Many rules have been broken already, what is one more? I could feel Time and Causality resisting my will, an action deemed utterly impossible by the foundational Concepts, this could not be done, they screamed.</p>
                    <p>I am named the Heavenly Demon, he who overturns the heavens and breaks all common sense.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Destiny, Anastasia.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Probability, Cristina.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Protection, Alden.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Life, Angela.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Battle, Aled.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Energy, Balaram.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Death, God Reaper.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Causality, the Authority of Karma, me.</p>
                    <p>14 Authorities, I am unworthy of it, my understanding over the concepts are not enough to handle most of the Authorities properly. Merely holding onto them puts a strain upon my Source, threatening to kill me before Nothing could.</p>
                    <p>The Heavenly Demon laughs.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Corruption, Lambis Milian.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Light, Wedath.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Sins, Sennin.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Freedom, Hevalir.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of D??ept??n, L??mi.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Hope, Tirme.</p>
                    <p>The Authority of Greed, Pommelaren.</p>
                    <p>Over the long course of history, there have only been 13 Absolute Transcendents. We have all lived since the beginning of creation. Only now did we realize, even Absolute Transcendents can die.</p>
                    <p>I am the last of the Great Guardians. The last of the Absolute Transcendents.</p>
                    <p>I am Lunovis.</p>
                    <p>It is insufficient, however, I will brute force it regardless. With the combined might of 21 Authorities I raised my hand and [REDACTED]</p>
                    <p>[REDACTED]</p>
                    <p>[REDACTED]</p>
                    <p>[RE-ACTED]</p>
                    <p>[RE-A-TED]</p>
                    <p>[RE-A--ED]</p>
                    <p>[RE-A---D]</p>
                    <p>So why? Why do you not move even now?</p>
                    <p>...Lunovis, you have done a great job, you even pulled of a ridiculous stunt to bring forth all of the Infinities hidden throughout history. But it seems even now, you do not possess a mind capable of understanding or even fathoming what it means to be [Infinite].</p>
                    <p>Then make me understand. You have the capability to do so, do you not?</p>
                    <p>The Records should not be distorted even more than it already is.</p>
                    <p>Forget the Records, I am talking about the now. At this very moment. You have paused the erosion of nothingness as if it is mere childsplay, so why do you not undo it all?</p>
                    <p>Again and again, you limit me, try to define me, capture me into a container you can understand. But even now, you fail to truly see what I mean. Why I refuse. Because I wish to keep your individuality intact.</p>
                    <p>When all hope is lost, may the Demon of the Skies light the way. I read this line in one of the restricted Records, as broken as it was, that one line remained intact. You may wish for me to keep my individuality, but I wish to be enlightened, to be the beacon of hope for the Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                    <p>...Ah, this is why it is so fun to turn off Omniscience. Very well. Let me show you.</p>
                    <p>{Infinity}</p>
                    <p>...</p>
                    <p>[Master Librarian Edit]: Further parts of the Record is undecipherable, even for me. In common terms, you could say the Record is corrupted and unreadable. However even the corrupted section of the Record is dangerous for my mind, hence, the latter part is cut off.</p>
                    <p>This Record will be placed in the Special Time Excerpts, locked. I will soon purge my own memories of this Record.</p>
