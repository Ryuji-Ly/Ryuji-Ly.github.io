                <div id="locked">
                    <p>The Grand War, the greatest and most gruesome war that ever was and will be. The participants of this catastrophe were the earliest generation of Immortals, the very first of them. It is the only war that involved the entire Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                    <p>The question is, how, why, when the scope of this war was so grand, no one has heard of it? Time Immortals who can travel to the past, Knowledge seekers with boundless time, Historians who seek the unearth the secrets of the beginning of creation. How come throughout the entire duration of the Myriad Multiverses, none have discovered what had happened?</p>
                    <p>Because we had to intervene. Destiny was cut. Time was locked. Space was sealed. Karma was erased. Records were purged. We did everything to prevent the happenings from being discovered. If it were solely due to how brutal the war was and how many Immortals had fallen due to it, we would not have to take such drastic actions. There lay a deeper secret.</p>
                    <p>Before we get to that, let us discuss what happened.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, understand that this is not a normal war. This is a war between Immortals. The heralds of this war were the Time Immortals, after all, what battle must be fought when you could travel through time and sabotage the history of your enemies and make it so they never existed in the first place? Of course, the target also had Time Immortals, who could counter and retaliate.</p>
                    <p>This led to entire universes being created and destroyed by the billions every single second. History was being rewritten and unwritten simultaniously. Clones of Immortals were sent on suicide missions to end timelines that others never even knew existed. At some point the overarching Myriad Multiverses' time was so fractured Angemartin had to step in to prevent the total collapse of the Dream.</p>
                    <p>Then there were the echoes of these phantom universes that wreaked havoc across the mortal realms, ruining the foundation of fath for Gods. The chaos brought about these incursions also caused timestorms, a powerful one could annihilate a multiverse.</p>
                    <p>Not to mention the use of Time to create artificial universes and parallel timelines to construct the perfect soldiers, harbingers of death. Genetically modified monsters designed solely to kill Immortals. Entire species created only to be wiped out from existence simply because their trait was inferior to another. Not to mention the countless other species that have never even existed, erased from history itself.</p>
                    <p>The Nullaris, more commonly known as Death Hunters were one of these abominations. They were wiped out during the final stages of the war, however Deus recreated and improved them before unleashing them into the Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                    <p>That said, the Time Immortals were not the only heavy lifters of the war. Quantum Immortals were feared, for they could destabilize the entire fabric of reality that made up a multiverse, erasing entire realms without regard to the consequences. Massive destructive energy released from these erased realms could cause chain reactions that potentially end a multiverse in an instant.</p>
                    <p>Fewer still were the Idea Immortals, the unit of size that is amongst the smallest, the place where universes are born. They could rewrite the laws and concepts of their multiverse, infinitely boosting the power and influence of its Immortals.</p>
                    <p>The average Supreme God, known as the pinnacle of power by most, can at most, destroy a multiverse, however it would drain their energy and leave them weakened. During the Grand War, it was the Dimensional, Spatial, Realm and other Immortals who fortified the multiverses, making them far more durable. Without these fortifications, any average Immortal during the Grand War could utterly obliterate hundreds of multiverses with their raw physical strength alone.</p>
                    <p>Yet, all this is without even taking into consideration the Immortals capable of creating multiverses. They were valued, as they could craft a multiverse tailored for themselves or others, which vastly increased their power levels. They were often hired to recreate destroyed multiverses as without the existence of their origin multiverse or integrating with a compatible multiverse, Immortals are drastically weakened and eventually erased.</p>
                    <p>The Corruption Immortals, precedecessors of the demon races would corrupt multiverses and turn them against one another.</p>
                    <p>Mortals were forced into the path of Immortality endlessly, only to be sent to the battlefields and die within seconds.</p>
                    <p>It was truly, the greatest and maddest war to have ever been fought, untold horrors, freaks of nature, abominations so inconceivable not even Immortals could comprehend them. All that which has been said up until now is merely a small fraction of the entire Grand War.</p>
                    <p>When all that is said and done, there is a part I wish to clarify before revealing the secret we Guardians have hidden. One might think that the earliest Immortals were powerful in comparison to those born after the Grand War. After all, the strongest Immortal of the modern times does not have the destructive ability a Grand War Immortal has.</p>
                    <p>The newer generation of Immortals had far more time to grow their power and refine their techniques. So why is it there is such a large difference in raw power? There is only one reason. It is also the reason why the Immortals of the Grand War waged the war in the first place.</p>
                    <p>Multiverse Devourer.</p>
                    <p>Immortals, the upper echelon of them at least, use universe cores as currency. What else is better in helping an Immortal advance their comprehension over laws than the core of a universe, which contains highly concentrated laws. In a matter of fact, some Immortals are tasked with artificially causing parallel worlds to form simply to harvest the universe's core, dooming this parallel world as it's laws slowly unravel until everything withers and dies.</p>
                    <p>With how self centered Immortals are, how could they not desire to devour the core of a multiverse? You could not devour your own multiverse, as then the very laws that make up your existence loses its anchor and you lose yourself, eventually erased. While other multiverses, it's Immortals would defend it to the death, not to mention the multiverse's will itself resisting. And when that is all done, there is the backlash. You are essentially enduring the backlash of all the time, space, possibilities, karma, fate, causality of the multiverse you have devoured. Of course, the power you gain from it is enough to offset this backlash, but that is only if you manage to devour the majority of the multiverse core. Which is not possible with all the Immortals that defend the core, as well as the curses of an entire multiverse.</p>
                    <p>Should an Immortal of the newer generation fight in the Grand War... there would have been a victor instead of everyone dying. Should a Supreme God fight in the Grand War... there would not be a Myriad Multiverses left to speak of.</p>
                    <p>Gahart solidified the multiversal barriers, no longer could Immortals travel freely between multiverses. Angemartin sealed the time of the Grand War, none within could leave it, while none after could go back to it. Those who dabble with time, divination and so on would only encounter a blank space should they try to go beyond this point in time.</p>
                    <p>I locked away the Records of the Grand War, purging many, only keeping the bare minimum, which were only accessible by me. Those who witnessed the war and it's end and lived to tell the tale, would never be able tell another.</p>
                    <p>God Reaper and Angela purged all lost Souls with the erosion of nothingness. Lunovis and Anastasia wiped away all remaining traces.</p>
                    <p>We Absolute Transcendents, or at least, the Guardians, though the remaining three others also act accordingly, are tasked with managing the Myriad Multiverses. In most cases, we take the approach of non-interference. Similarly we had let the War happen as we knew it's consequences, as well as what it had created. The Realm of Immortals, which was deemed beneficial to the Myriad Multiverses as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The exact happenings of the War were still murky, with some effort, they could peer through this murkiness, however due to the nature of the Grand War, even for the Absolute Transcendents, the fine details were lost.</p>
                    <p>The event was powerful enough to desync their consciousness from the Time Stream, and the variant mind that was desynced did not retain access to our Omniscience. Hence, we did not understand the implications of events that could influence the Time Stream so much it disconnected Absolute Transcendents, we were not even aware of this desyncing.</p>
                    <p>When our variant minds deduced that if they did not interfere with the events of the Grand War itself, a being of similar status could be born, we did not hold back.</p>
                    <p>Our Authority can be challenged. Our pride can be torn. Our power may be questioned. Out dominion can be contested. Our unity may crack. Our wisdom can be doubted.</p>
                    <p>But our duty to safeguard the Myriad Multiverses must never be threatened.</p>
                    <p>An existence of unknown nature that could have an equal spectrum of existence cannot be tolerated.</p>
                    <p>That is the oh so great secret we Absolute Transcendents desperately hid. The Dreamers must never know they can reach our heights by devouring pieces of the [Dream].</p>
