                <h2>Record of Activities</h2>
                <p>The Entity Falhorn, known as The First Mage of the Planet of Ael. A war hero in the battle against demonkind. Praised to be the founder of Magic for the rest of humanity, He is the first God to emerge from the Planet of Ael.</p>
                <p>A weak man. Fragments of Lunovis innately hold immense potential, however Falhorn never tapped into it out of fear of that power. Had he truly wished for it, he would have never died, lost for eternity in the Sea of Time.</p>
                <p>Although the Planet of Ael is created by the God Ael, he neglected it, it was Falhorn who became a guardian god of the planet. Instead of venturing out to grow stronger and imprint his mark on the history of Immortals, he remained near the planet, unknown to most except the residents of the planet. Eventually he took on the role of the Custodian of the Wheel of Time.</p>
                <p>He ensured the history of his home planet remained uncorrupted and protected it for many millennia. That was, until a day a child appeared in the Sea of Time. The child looked up at him with such innocence, unaware of the massive power that demanded Falhorn to take action. He knew instinctively, an ability deep within the child required an action from him, and it could easily force him to comply if he refused it.</p>
                <p>Falhorn found it absurd, he, a God and a Fragment of Lunovis was being compelled into action by a mortal. However he could similarly sense the child was a resident of the world he protected, and how the World Spirit needed the child. And so, Falhorn spun the Wheel of Time.</p>
                <p>Reversing all the timelines, erasing them forever. He was surprised to find he had not vanished despite disrupting the flow of time, yet, it was not entirely without consequences. His soul was breaking into pieces. Nothing he couldn't recover from.</p>
                <p>The child appeared in front of him once more. And again. And again. Each time at different ages, with different experiences. And each time, Falhorn spun the wheel, even without the dreadful power within the boy prompting him.</p>
                <p>He was not permitted the time to recover from the damages accumulating each time he spun the Wheel. He pitied the boy. Doomed to start anew with no recollection of anything only to die in a few years. Many times later, the child finally gained an ability to carry over his memories across time. Falhorn always cheered him on.</p>
                <p>But, no matter how resilient his soul was, he could not endure forever. He had the option to relinquish his duty as Custodian, but pressed on, even as his soul was less than a quintillionth of its original size. He spun the Wheel. One last time.</p>
