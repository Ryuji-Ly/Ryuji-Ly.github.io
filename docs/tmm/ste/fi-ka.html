        <h1>STE FI-KA</h1>
        <div id="container">
            <article id="general">
                <h2>General</h2>
                <p><strong>Location</strong>: Merkuyues' Multiverse, Life Universe: Variant 8343, Hyperion Supercluster, Unnamed Galaxy, Planet of Ael, Ameuthe Continent, Empire of Dabaira</p>
                <p><strong>Event</strong>: Birth of [First of Infinity], Kannon Angevin.</p>
                <p><strong>Reason for STE</strong>: Entity I-KA-1, more commonly known as Kannon Angevin, The Sinner of Time, The Saint and Harbinger of Chaos. The scope of his influence in his prime reached 6 multiverses, without restraints, it would have been at minimum 500. While there is already an STE under the category Record of Zero, Entity I-KA-1 himself deserves a record outside of his identity as [First of Infinity]. He did not attain Transcendence, the minimum requirement for individual Entities to be recorded separately in an STE, however his ability, power and authorty surpasses many Transcendents.</p>
            </article>
            <article id="record">
                <h2>Record of Activities</h2>
                <p>On birth, Entity I-KA-1 was already prophesied to be a Saint, a Savior who would unite the continent and lead civilization towards prosperity. There had been many attempts to assassinate I-KA-1, most having ended in failure but some succeeded.</p>
                <p>The Planet of Ael could not allow the death of I-KA-1, the World Spirit knew that without I-KA-1, it would not be able to survive imminent destruction, neither was there enough time to wait for another Entity to be born with similar potential. Thus, the World Spirit betted on Entity I-KA-1, expending most of its energy to uncover and awaken one of the dormant abilities within Entity I-KA-1. Absolute Regression.</p>
                <p>Briefly explaining the nature of "Absolute", this modifier was attached to the ability Regression due to how it overwhelms everything else. Regression is an act that defies cause and brings imbalance. This can lead to the attention of the Warden of Time who would purge the convoluted timelines. Absolute Regression erases all branched timelines. It does not allow any other branches in time other than itself.</p>
                <p>The total number of regressions Entity I-KA-1 has gone through is lost due to the Absolute nature of the regression, however it is estimated to be close to 4.000 times.</p>
                <p>With each regression, I-KA-1's Source gains more independence from the universal concepts thereby giving I-KA-1 more access to his uniqueness. In simple terms, with each regression, he gains more abilities. However at some point, I-KA-1 sacrificed most of those abilities to gain a shard of Callistars(Refer to STE RoZ Callistars for more details).</p>
                <p>Aside from the uniqueness within I-KA-1's Source, there is also the matter of his bloodline ability.</p>
                <p>The Planet of Ael was designed and created by God Ael, son of Lifael Igurdis. There are far more potential and abilities for the dominant species, variant humanoid. Most of these abilities became concentrated in a select few families. Within the planet these families were called Houses, they were descendents of the first 20 Gods who came after Entity L-F-531(Refer to STE GGL-F-531 for more details). Their abilities varied from manipulating time, space, reality to more mundane, enhancing eyesight, defence, healing, mind control, cloning and so on.</p>
                <p>The bloodline ability of the House Angevin is an advanced version of "Berserker". There more one witnesses death, the stronger one becomes. This description is a misinterpretation of the actual ability. The original definition is as such: Limitless scaling based on comprehension regarding Death.</p>
                <p>Note, the destruction the World Spirit of the Planet of Ael felt was caused by I-KA-1's presence. Ironically, if it had never awakened the ability Absolute Regression, the calamity would have never happened.</p>
                <p>Merkuyues' Multiverse is special in the way it is an artificial multiverse created by Merkuyues. It was created with copies of various Immortals and even a Supreme God, The Heavens. Merkuyues' plan was to superimpose the multiverse upon the Realm of Immortals while merging the consciousness of the copies with the original. Using the confusion take over The Heavens' mind.</p>
                <p>It is only due to the presence of a colossal powerhouse such as I-KA-1 which destabilized the laws of the multiverse so much it could not be hidden. Once this scandal was discovered, many Divine Societies were enraged and launched a full on assault on the multiverse. Various "Sovereigns" as they called it, were planted within the multiverse by Divine Societies to act as scouts.</p>
                <p>I-KA-1 regressed several times in search of a way to prevent this, which only accelerated the assault. In the end, I-KA-1 had to give up and leave his origin multiverse and become a wanderer.</p>
                <p>The Multiverse of Merkuyues was not completely destroyed, some Immortals even admired it, as it was the first time an entire multiverse was created artificially. However many years later the multiverse was obliterated by the Marauder of Heaven.</p>
                <p>With I-KA-1's origin multiverse destroyed, so were its concepts and laws. Without Transcendence to anchor his existence, it meant the building blocks of their very existence was degrading and vanishing. Due to I-KA-1's uniqueness, he survived, however his loved one, family and friends he took with him did not. It did not take long for even that karma to be washed clean. The Entity I-KA-1 from before the destruction of the multiverse and after can be considered entirely different people.</p>
                <p>At some point, he became the summon of another. Without any memories to define him. I-KA-1 followed the orders of his summoner until he died. Many years after that, he became the king od a galaxy. The kingdom was also ruined as time passed.</p>
                <p>I-KA-1 gradually lost sense of self, forever losing the chance to obtain Transcendence. In return, he reached a special state of enlightenment.</p>
                <p>Thus, I-KA-1 became [First of Infinity].</p>
