                <p>The Entity formarly known as Kannon Angevin was the first to truly integrate with his uniqueness. The Entity, referred in the Records as I-KA-1, is one of the soul fragments of [Infinity], more commonly known as the Entity Deus.</p>
                <p>As the first of his kind, I-KA-1 paved the way for other fragments of [Infinity] to truly become a part of [Infinity]. I-KA-1 also opened up an entirely new system of power that did not belong to the path of Immortals, Transcendents and Absolutes.</p>
                <p>[First of Infinity] created the N of Infinity series, and has helped I-PF-2, I-G-3, I-AH-4, I-JP-5, I-TKRS-6, I-GB-7, I-DS-8 become a part of [Infinity]. Each of these Entities have experienced their own fair share of tragedy and glory. Much like I-KA-1 however, they chose to remain hidden from the [Dream] until requested by the Absolute Transcendents.</p>
                <p>The Second to Eight of Infinity each also helped more Entities fully integrate with their own uniqueness.</p>
                <p>Fear the Day, those of [Infinity] are needed by the Keepers of the [Dream].</p>
