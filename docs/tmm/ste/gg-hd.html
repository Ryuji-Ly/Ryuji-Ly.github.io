                <h2>Record of Activities</h2>
                <p>The Absolute Transcendent Lunovis, also known as the Heavenly Demon. The duty assigned to Lunovis is to maintain the karmic balance. Karma has many definitions across the [Dream]. However in essence, it is the bond that connects all. It is the result and consequence of causality. On its own, Karma already acts as the balancer, however there are always those that can disrupt the neutrality of karma so much there is no turning back. It is the Heavenly Demons who correct these situations.</p>
                <p>While most Absolute Transcendents merely dabble in the Source World to solidify their existence, Lunovis has mastered the Source. Capable of merging the Sources of others into his own, perfectly transforming an entity into himself, while maintaining their previous identity on top of it. As such, it is impossible to truly identify Lunovis. His existence in my eyes is one that seems to be spread out across trillions of entities, and yet, every single one can act as the true Absolute Transcendent, the Heavenly Demon.</p>
                <p>Ah, have I mentioned the fickleness of Lunovis? It should also be noted somewhere in the public records regarding entities. Lunovis is always in a state of half immersion to the Time Stream. As such, he does not see Time in it's base form, yet experiences it in a similar way.</p>
                <p>When all hope is lost, may the Demon of the Skies light the way.</p>
