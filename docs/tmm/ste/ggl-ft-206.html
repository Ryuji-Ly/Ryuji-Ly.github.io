                <h2>Record of Activities</h2>
                <p>The Entity known as Fen Tian is a being born strong. He is a special case among the Faces of Lunovis in that his soul was already a soul fragment of Lunovis. The name he chose for himself, meaning Burn the Heavens in his origin language is a statement against the Ruler of Gods, The Heavens.</p>
                <p>His end goal is to kill The Heavens, however he lacked the conditions to do so. Providence and Karma heavily favoured The Heavens as they kept the multiverse in balance. The duty of a Face of Lunovis meant he could not use the abilities granted to him as one of the Faces to kill The Heavens, and with his power alone, he could not contend against The Heavens who remained within the safety of their Domain at all times.</p>
                <p>When the opportunity arose during an event called the Empyrean Game of Godhood, during which he accepted a disciple named Lifael Igurdis who would later be known as the Life Sovereign.</p>
                <p>While his diciple went on a rampage and caused chaos in the multiverse, Fen Tian continously brought down various allied forces of The Heavens, preparing and setting the stage for the final showdown between his diciple and The Heavens.</p>
                <p>They succeeded, at which point Fen Tian left in search of his hometown, unaware that The Heavens had contingency plans in case he was truly killed. A technique that could reverse even the destruction of their soul.</p>
                <p>After finding the remains of his old planet, Fen Tian was finally able to let go of the past and being rising in strength earnestly. The Realm of Immortals paid close attention to this rising junior. Only for Fen Tian to mysterious vanish in the Lesser Voids.</p>
                <p>It took many cycles in the Realm of Immortals before Fen Tian returned, and just as abruptly, descended to a faraway multiverse, focusing on carrying out the duty of the Heavenly Demon.</p>
