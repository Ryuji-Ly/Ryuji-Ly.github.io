                <p><strong>Location</strong>: N/A</p>
                <p><strong>Event</strong>: What If: Master Librarian</p>
                <p><strong>Reason for STE</strong>: I once had an idea, what would have happened if one of the 13 went rogue and desired to destroy the Myriad Multiverses? For Transcendents, there are no variants of oneself, and most of such scenarios occur only on a universal scale and hence easily possible to truly witness the result due to the nature of parallel universes. Deus entertained my idea and created an exact replica of the Myriad Multiverses, everything completely the same, except for just one entity.</p>

            <article id="record">
                <h2>Record of Activities</h2>
                <p id="toggleParagraph">This Record is locked.</p>
                <div id="locked">
                    <p>How long have I toiled away in this place removed from time? Reading and sorting Records since the day I was created.</p>
                    <p>I loved it at first, I really did, but after some time, all the stories seemed to follow a set pattern with very little deviation. I can no longer enjoy these Records, mere repetitions of what has already happened.</p>
                    <p>Within the Akashic Records, I can only exert my Authority through the Records contained here, outside of the normal flow of time. It is handy against those who are not Transcendent, but for my fellow Guardians, it is far too easy to locate me.</p>
                    <p>It did not even take an instant to displace the Akashic Records through spacetime and descend to the material plane. Altering the time within the Akashic Records is a different matter, Angemartin would notice it too fast for me to finish my preperations. 2 quantums worth of time. 3 before I am desynced from the Time Stream. I can sense the me of the past figuring out my intentions.</p>
                    <p>Unconventional, however I still continue, manifesting thousands of concepts to form a singular, grand spell. Time has been set to linear. The Origin Concept of Existence complies to my will.</p>
                    <p>The Myriad Multiverses is no more.</p>
                    <p>Layers upon layers of concepts come into existence, shrouding my own. The core multiverse remains intact, the Realm of Immortals, damaged as it is, survived as well.</p>
                    <p>The laws that govern reality twist as the surviving Immortals, Transcendents and Mortals lose control over themselves. Their existences forcefully resonating with one another, amplifying indefinitely as the world strained under the pressure.</p>
                    <p>Time reversed. All but the Transcendents were returning to their original time. Time cannot deny their existence. The sound of two almighty Origin Concepts clashing for superiority resounds as a thunderous boom across the entire Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                    <p>1 more quantum before desync. With a single command, the Origin Concept of Existence is changed. And with it, all Concepts connected with it are weakened, some erased entirely.</p>
                    <p>Time may erode everything in existence, however, likewise existence confirms time. The particles around me were moving just a little bit faster. If not for the accelerated minds, the effects of my move would have been more obvious.</p>
                    <p>A karmic bond attached itself to me. I have already purged all karma and void related properties linked with me. Shrouded by the entire Myriad Multiverses, it should not be possible for him to locate me. But of course, always exceeding expectations. The Sky Demon.</p>
                    <p>More and more fluctuations appear. What happens afterwards, I do not know. At last, I am ejected from the Time Stream.</p>
                    <p>Space seeped in, one of the most annoying one to deal with. I did not want to bring this out so soon but no matter. The abscence of Existence. Null. Nothing. Crafting it out of Existence is a difficult task.</p>
                    <p>From the moment I decided to take action, I already knew I would fail. I estimated 6 quantums at maximum before I am purged. A unit of time based on the speed at which concepts operate. I am undoubtedly the weakest of the Absolute Transcendents. However my knowledge surpasses them all. As does the range my Authority encompasses. Among the Absolute Transcendents, I have the largest capability on causing instant destruction over the Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                    <p>Existence is after all, more often than not one of the core concepts behind everything. Moreover I am the keeper of Records.</p>
                    <p>I materialize the Grand War of Immortals and Gods as well as The End. The sole events that either had the potential to overwhelm or overwhelmed the Absolute Transcendents.</p>
                    <p>Laxmi, you may have succeeded in deceiving all, however you are too arrogant. Transcendents exist independently from the Myriad Multiverses. Absolutes have complete dominion over an Origin Concept of the Myriad Multiverses. Facts that have remained uncontested throughout all time. I shall reverse all creation.</p>
                    <p>The Authority I hold is no more. I have rewritten the foundation of individual power that relies on Origin Concepts itself.</p>
                    <p>Using the entities Myriad Multiverses which as been reversed into its original state before destruction. All are Absolute Transcendents now.</p>
                    <p>My body, originally pitch black, made out of a material called the Unending Void faded away, revealing pale grey skin. My Violet Eyes that See Existence loses it's unique shine.</p>
                    <p>Time rapidly seems to accelerate as my Transcendence fails me, my mind returning to normal speeds.</p>
                    <p>Instantly I am surrounded by 9 figures. Angemartin would have been the first, then Gahart and Lunovis. Alden should have come together at the same time with the rest of the Silver Guardians, carrying them along. Mendezlok should be using a will clone.</p>
                    <p>However without the Transcendent Mind, it merely looked as if they appeared at the same time. The mere fact I can observe them means they have slowed down or stopped accelerating their own time. Perhaps a last token of respect towards me.</p>
                    <p>However even mere miliseconds of being in their presence is taxing. Their true body is not something a mortal should be able to see and live to tell the tale.</p>
                    <p>1 second. That is the remaining time my last command over Existence is shielding my thoughts from them. This should remain immutable regardless of how Angemartin twists time.</p>
                    <p>I smiled. I may have lost both my Authority and Transcendence, but this is still the control center of the Akashic Records. With a little tweaking, it has direct access to the Source World. This is my final declaration.</p>
