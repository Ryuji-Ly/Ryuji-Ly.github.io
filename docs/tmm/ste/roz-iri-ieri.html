                <p>Armament Iri and Iëri, the twin guns. Iri's base state heals all Entities it hits, while Iëri's base state applies curses to all Entities it hits.</p>
                <p>So long there is a source of energy, the twin guns can create an infinite supply of bullets, however it can also take in anything and transmute it into bullets. Potent forms of energy can make the resulting bullet even more powerful. The wielder can for example, choose to sacrifice years of their lifespan to drastically enhance the bullets fired.</p>
                <p>Aside from its normal state bullets, it is also capable of enchanting all bullets within its chambers with various effects and even stacking them. An few examples of this, the explosive stun web bullets, formation element duplication bullets, duplication echo purification and so on.</p>
                <p>Of course, these do not use the twin nature of the guns properly. Some more simple enchantements are the time-lock and temporal displacement, or the gravity well and anti gravity. There are various other combinations but in essence, it uses opposite effects to induce what is effectively a real life glitch in reality and further enhances it.</p>
