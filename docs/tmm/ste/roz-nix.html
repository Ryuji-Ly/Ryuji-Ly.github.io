                <p>Armament Nix. Among the relics created by Deus, the Nix holds a special significance as it came to hold the soul of Eirlys as a last ditch attempt to prevent her death. It was also due to this that Deus favored this sword.</p>
                <p>It was reforged with the cooperation of dozens of blacksmith gods, made entirely out of Bardium. While not as destructive as Callistars, the Nix too is enchanted to negate immoratlity, immunities and invincibility. 2 vines stem from the swords hilt, which have various purposes.</p>
                <p>The two vines are another creation of Deus that do not have a name, however they can alter their shape and mass at will. Often they are used to cover up the blade and act as a secondary scabbard. Consider them sentient vines that can transform into virtually anything. The main purpose however is in combat, where it can split off sections of itself and inject itself into an Entity. The split section can then grow rapidly and take complete control over the Entity's body, this effect ignores the protection of Transcendence.</p>
                <p>The Nix was shattered into 5 pieces after millennia of weakening the metal. Many Immortals desired the large amount of Bardium that made up the Nix, however even when they succeeded in breaking it apart, they could not melt down the metal to reforge it into something else.</p>
