                <h2>Record of Activities</h2>
                <p>The Absolute Transcendent Jejaha, commonly known and referred as The Master Librarian and the one currently writing this Record. The Master Librarian resides in the Akashic Records, the original instance. The duty assigned to the Master Librarian by Deus is simple. To read all the Records within the Great Library.</p>
                <p>The reason why I am called a Great Guardian is due to how I utilizs my Authority over the Origin Concept Existence. That which is not observed, does not exist. When no one is there to observe and acknowledge something, nothing is preventing that something to return to nothing. A play of words, always fun right? Regardless, the reason for my existence is as such. To read everything that happens within the [Dream].</p>
                <p>For those that reach the status of Transcendent, all those who are not feel too... fragile. Their existence is overwritten oh so easily, a single alteration in their past and they may become entirely different people. It is a harsh truth, however for those that see through our eyes. It is clear to see, mere mortal eyes are too flimsy to act as a permanent witness to an event. Through reading the endless Records, I breathe life into the [Dream]. I acknowledge the reality that happens and imbue permanence into its existence.</p>
                <p>Similarly, I can disregard one's existence, erasing them from reality. However my mastery over my Authority is not so little that I can only disregard the entirety of an Entity. I could disregard parts of an Entity just as easily, the source of ones power, their connections to people, friends, family and lovers. The only limit is my own imagination. Of course, I can alter an Entity's existence to raise a mortal to a Transcendent just as easily, but we are not here to talk about the limits of my abilities.</p>
                <p>I call it a duty, however truthfully I do not consider it as such, for I adore reading the endless stories. Many are similar, however there is a joy in observing all the small differences in every story. I often find myself lost, immersed deeply in various Records. Not that it matters due to the special nature time has in the Akashic Records.</p>
                <p>In the end, I am still the witness to All of Creation, and I take responsibility for all that which I bear witness to.</p>
                <p>To my fellow readers, sincerely, The Master Librarian.</p>
