                    <p>The Origin Concept of Nothing, the first Origin Concept. The relationship between Nothing and Infinity is rather peculiar. The Origin Concept of Nothing could be said to only exist solely because Something existed which proved that the absence of Something existed as well. Without Infinity being born, the Origin Concept of Nothing couldn't have existed either, however without Nothing, Infinity would not have been born.</p>
                    <p>A fascinating paradox that unfortunately will not be discussed in this Record. This Record serves as proof of Nothing's Existence, as well as the timeless war between Nothing and Infinity.</p>
                    <p>Infinity created. Nothing returned. From the beginning of time, till the very end of creation, this cycle never stopped. New worlds, universes, multiverses were constantly created. While Nothing always continued eroding the [Dream], returning all existence back to nothingness.</p>
                    <p>Infinity created the Great Guardians who were given various duties that ensured the continued existence of the [Dream]. Nothing corrupted the space and dimensions of the [Dream], leaving the majority of it hostile to all life.</p>
                    <p>Infinity formed a consciousness and condensed itself into physical form, which was named Deus.</p>
                    <p>The existence only Infinity knows of, Nothing too, gained sentience, forcing the Origin Concept into reality. This physical manifestation of Nothing attempted to kill Deus while he was still weak, unadapted to wielding Infinity in a physical body, his existence still scattered into various timelines. He had to flee across time and space repeatedly, unable to rest nor hide. Unable to defeat Nothing regardless of how infinite his strength was.</p>
                    <p>And yet, Deus achieved Transcendence. The identity that is Deus and the Origin Concept of Infinity became one and the same. However how do you kill a concept that does not exist?</p>
                    <p>You force it into existence. Already, has it been done. From giving it actual influence over the [Dream] by allowing its corruption and erosion, making it tangible to the residents of the [Dream], to making it form a consciousness and a manifestation. Once Nothing is anchored, it becomes Something. The very essence of the Origin Concept denies its own definition, causing self destruction to complete and return to true Nothing.</p>
                    <p>However this timeless war should not have happened in the first place. From the moment Infinity was born, it signified Nothing could not erase Infinity nor surpress it entirely. This gap became more apparant when the [Dream] was created and enroached upon Nothing's territory. Despite all this, Infinity allowed Nothing.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, Deus was bored.</p>
