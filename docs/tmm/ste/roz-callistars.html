                <h2>Record of Activities</h2>
                <p>Armament Callistars. Among the Relics of Deus, Callistars was specially crafted with a singular purpose. The intent to kill. It was forged to channel the rage pre-Transcedence Deus had somewhere else. It was a way to vent the self-blame he felt for allowing the death of his wife Eirlys while he sleeping.</p>
                <p>Callistars is a weapon that destroys reality. A weapon that can force the end of an Origin Concept. It has a total of 7 built in forms. It's first form is that of a polearm enchanted with the Origin Concept of Mass, it's second form is that of a red spear, this too, enchanted with the Origin Concept of Piercing, the third form is that of a sword, enchanted with the Origin Concept of Boundless, the fourth form is a bow, enchanted with the Origin Concept of Inevitable, the fifth form is that of a shield, enchanted with the Origin Concept of Indestructible, the sixth form are the endless chains, enchanted with the Origin Concept of Restriction.</p>
                <p>The final and it's true form is a scythe. All the previous forms were later added on to act as a restriction placed upon Callistars. The Scythe is made up of the Origin Concepts of Mass, Piercing, Boundless, Inevitable, Indestructible, Restriction, Cut, End and Destruction given physical form. Additional clarification, it is not a manifestation of the Origin Concepts, it is the actual Origin Concepts themselves that are Callistars.</p>
                <p>Do note that initially the weapon that is also called the Incarnate of Deus was not as destructive nor as high in status. pre-Transcendence could only work with universe grade concepts, however it was designed to grow infinitely as it also had a sizeable chunk of Deus' own existence imbued into it, allowing it to climb higher and higher until it could forcefully crystalize Origin Concept into itself.</p>
                <p>The 6 forms that were layered on top of Callistars are not the only restrictions placed upon it. It is a weapon far to powerful to be wielded carelessly, as it could allow even the weakest of Entities to effectively kill a Transcendent with a simple strike. It has a total of 13 additional restrictions. Conditions that if met, release a fragment of its true power.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The enemy must be deemed a threat to the world.</li>
                    <li>The enemy must have committed an irredeemable act of injustice.</li>
                    <li>The enemy must be stronger than the wielder.</li>
                    <li>The enemy must be an Immortal.</li>
                    <li>The enemy must be a Transcendent.</li>
                    <li>The enemy must be an Absolute.</li>
                    <li>The battle is one against many.</li>
                    <li>The battle must be for a greater good.</li>
                    <li>The battle must take place in a location of significance for the wielder.</li>
                    <li>The battle must take place at an auspicious time</li>
                    <li>The wielder must be willing to sacrifice themselves.</li>
                    <li>The wielder must be in a state of extreme focus.</li>
                    <li>The wielder must be of pure heart.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The definition of "World", "Injustice", "Greater Good", "Location of Significance", "Auspicious Time" will vary depending on the wielder of Callistars.</p>
                <p>Callistars is the only weapon that can truly harm Deus.</p>
