                <h3>The Beginning of Everything</h3>
                <p>At first, there was Nothing. It was the only thing that existed. The concept of Nothing is the most ancient and contradictory concept. After all, how could Nothing be something that is described. Even more so, the very concept of Time, Power, Contradiction did not exist yet, or even just the concept of Concepts.</p>
                <p>Much later, or perhaps just the very next instant, a second concept was born. It was a failed imitationo of Nothing. The Nothing that seemingly stretched endlessly across everything. This second concept was Infinity. Many more concepts were derived from Infinity, among the first were Eternity, Endless, Order, Chaos and Spacetime. This moment in time is also known to be the observable limit for the Transcendents.</p>
                <p>The concepts manifested laws. Laws shaped reality and created a world. The first world to ever exist. By those aware of its existence, it is called the Egg of the Multiverse. On this "egg", the first life was created through the amalgamation of laws. It was a nameless creature without sentience, but the many Supreme Gods would remember this creature as the True Origin Primordial God, while some others would call it the first Heavenly Dao. As the amalgamation of laws and concepts, the creature's life was deeply interconnected with the world's continued existence. Time moved on, the "egg" continued to develop, while more and more concepts were born and refined. At some point, the first life died of old age, and thus, the "egg" hatched.</p>

                <h3>Birth of the Myriad Multiverses</h3>
                <p>The first world exploded into countless fragments, each becoming the core of a multiverse of its own. Each multiverse held a seemingly infinite number of universes, planes, realms and dimensions.</p>
                <p>Each fragment of the first world of course had varying ratios of laws, it was this ratio that determined the main nature of each multiverse. Besides this, each multiverse used the fragmentory laws to recreate their own versions of the original concepts, their universes similary replicated the multiversal version of the concepts. This meant there were various versions of the same concept, all derived from the original from the first world. These origin concepts still existed, however they were forgotten.</p>
                <p>From then on, each multiverse developed differently, beginning their own stories.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="after-the-creation-myth">
                <h3>After the Creation Myth</h3>
                <p>While the multiverses each had their own development path, a lot of them did share some similarities. Namely, the birth of conceptual and primal gods. It was due to their existence that most life forms were created, and therefore born sentient and intelligent. It was relatively peaceful, however strength remained supreme. It was only after the first deaths they grew afraid. They were created without any knowledge about death, it was unfamiliar, and thus they found it unnatural.</p>
                <p>They dared to try and defy death, for they quickly understood what use was strength if a single death was all it took to take it all away? As it was still the Primordial Era, there were many opportunities. Soon, the first mortal who became an Immortal emerged. They had found ways to prolong their lifespan to indefinite, after which began the search to truly defy death. Methods that allowed one to survive being killed. In the more developed multiverses, being an Immortal became the first requirement to being a true powerhouse. Regardless how you much power you had, without immortality, you were considered weak. A mere flicker in the passage of time. Millenia had passed, the majority had long since discovered the existence of parallel universes. Aside from the initial scuffles, it was peaceful, yet also gruesome. Many Immortals managed to assimilate their multiversal variants, becoming stronger and stronger until they were the sole remaining variant of themselves in the multiverse.</p>
                <p>The following trillions of years were exceedingly peaceful, it was a period of accumulation, no method to avoid death was absolute, and more and more techniques were created to counter the methods of other Immortals, so more and more ways to defy death were created. Some of the more older Immortals even had thousands of methods to avoid death. With so many failsafes, the Immortals were more daring and quickly grew their power. However this era of peace came to an end when they discovered the multiversal barriers, evidence of other multiverses.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="grand-war">
                <h3>The Grand War of Immortals and Gods</h3>
                <p>This is a war forgotten by most, yet it's aftermath affected the Myriad Multiverses until the end of time itself. Before this war, there were billions of multiverses. It was devastating, almost the entirety of reality as a whole was wiped out, leaving barely a few hundred thousand multiverses. In the entirety of the Myriad Multiverses, there was rarely an occurance the number of multiverses exceeded a million after this war.</p>
                <p>Centillions of Immortals were wiped out with permanent death. Their so-called Immortality was fragile against those who knew the same methods and searched ways to bypass them. Despite how destructive this war was, the more peaceful and rational Immortals have tried to mend the worlds, however most of the destruction was irreparable and destroyed multiverses could not be brought back. Considering many of the Immortals' power and immortality was vested on their multiverses laws, it was discovered destroying a multiverse could greatly weaken an Immortal originating from that multiverse, sometimes outright killing them.</p>
                <p>There was so little left of the Myriad Multiverses when the very last Immortal of the Grand War fell. A handful, just a very lucky 9 Immortals who avoided the wars and somehow survived where all that was left of the Immortals. These 9 were perhaps the only witnesses to one of the most beautiful things of the Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                <p>The countless bodies of fallen Immortals, some as small as a speck of dust, others as large as entire universes, the shattered remains of billions of multiverses, realms, dimensions etc. All these gathered to form one place. A place that would be known as the Realm of Immortals, the hub of the Myriad Multiverses.</p>
                <p>The Realm of Immortals is accessible from anywhere in the Myriad Multiverses, so long certain requirements are met. After the Grand War the spatial barriers between multiverses solidified, no longer allowing intermultiversal travel. Only extremely powerful or very talented spatial Immortals had a chance at travelling to different multiverses. The Realm of Immortals was the only way you could interact and perhaps travel to different multiverses.</p>

            <section id="the-golden-age-of-immortals">
                <h3>The Golden Age of Immortals</h3>
                <p>Epochs after the Grand War of Immortals and Gods, on the very remains of the fallen Immortals, the First Divine Society Era was formed. Three out of nine surviving Immortals of the Grand War belong to this Divine Society.</p>
                <p>Through the collaboration of many multiverses, a new status was defined. The Supreme Gods, the strongest Pinnacle Immortal God of their own respective multiverse. This new status and title was engraved within the very laws of the Realm, empowering the Supreme Gods further.</p>
                <p>Closely after, a Council made up by the Supreme Gods was created. They would be able to dictate the direction of development for the overwhelming majority of the Realm of Immortals and its Divine Societies.</p>
                <p>Without equals, the Supreme Council reigned over the Realm of Immortals, forcing submission of all those weaker than them.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="rise-of-the-deus-empire">
                <h3>Rise of the Deus Empire</h3>
                <p>The Deus Empire, the first Divine Empire was formed by pre-Transcendence Deus, formed out of 17 megaplanets. This period of time, although only a few thousand years long, is significant as Deus had forcefully dragged the arrogant Supreme Gods down from their kingdom to serve as mere civil servants. Aside from the original 17 megaplanets, the Deus Empire never expanded, nor needed to.</p>
                <p>The existence of Deus alone could create an endless supply of resources. He crafted countless legendary armaments which have lasted for many eons of use. Invented new metals to suit his purposes, no Immortal has been able to improve or create better metals.</p>
                <p>Above all else, was the creation of the World System. A system that allowed the most talentless of all to rise and become a powerhouse among Gods. So long one put in the effort, with the World System, anything is possible.</p>
                <p>With the appearance of Deus, it was also the first time a Transcendent had been artificially created, much less six of them. The Silver Guardians were famous for many reasons, for those that did not belong to the Deus Empire, it was the fact they were entirely artificial Transcendents that made them stand out. Even more so when they were far more stable than most Transcendents.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="the-silver-era-of-the-deus-empire">
                <h3>The Silver Era of the Deus Empire</h3>
                <p>The birth of the entity named Laxmi. The First of the Constellations revealed themselves to the world, challenging the authority of the Supreme Council.</p>
                <p>Deus disappeared. The three Grand Generals led their immortal armies to a battle for the throne. This event is widely known as the Bloodless War, while the era was known as the Blood Era. The Immortal Gods returned to their former glory, cutting off all connection with the Deus Empire while purging their own kingdoms to bury their shame.</p>
                <p>All the Supreme Gods were summoned to the Supreme Council, however the meeting ended without conclusion. Captain of the Silver Guardians, Alden awoke and put an end to the Bloodless War while ascending to the throne himself. Alden turned a blind eye when his friend and comrade Admon Carter dethroned the First Spirit King and destabilized the Spirit Plane.</p>
