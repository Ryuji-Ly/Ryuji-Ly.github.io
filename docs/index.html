                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I acknowledge that GitHub pages are predominantly used as a platform for programming or some kind of CV, but in my case I would like to use it to display the world I have designed as a writer. Aside from the fact that I don't have to go through the hassles to choose and register domains it is also a conscious choice to also show my ability to use HTML and CSS while bringing my world design to life.</p>
                <p>It is recommended you start with the Creation Myth of The Myriad Multiverses which is found in the History & Lore section.</p>
